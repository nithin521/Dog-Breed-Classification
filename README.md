# Dog-Breed-Classification using ResNet18 and EfficientNetB2

This repository contains a complete implementation of a Dog Breed Classification application using deep learning models, specifically ResNet18 and EfficientNetB2. The project includes a trained neural network to classify images of dogs into one of 120 predefined breeds. 

Features

Deep Learning Models: Combines ResNet18 and EfficientNetB2 for accurate classification.

Web Interface: Users can upload dog images and receive predictions directly from the web application.

Top Predictions: Displays the top 3 predicted breeds with confidence scores.

Data Augmentation: Improves model generalization using rotation, flipping, zoom, and brightness adjustments.
